        This is an international conference of schools sharing a number of ideals
        and attitudes, and having a common way of education as being vitally
        concerned with the development of the whole person. Representatives of six
        schools whose philosophy and ideals were inspired by late Dr Kurt Hahn, the
        founder of the Salem (Germany) and Gordonstoun (Scotland) schools, met in
        Salem in 1966, and under the chairmanship of His Majesty King Constantine of
        Greece, decided to start the conference. The second meeting took place at
        Gordonstoun in a building called Round Square and the conference was named
        thus.
        <br>
         Scotland the administrative centre of an estate is often called the
        square, and the square at Gordonstoun is a beautiful and unique circular
        stone building constructed in the 17th century and the name is derived from
        it. The conference, which a different school hosts each year to mixed
        delegations of heads, staff, pupils and governors, provides an annual forum
        for the exchange of experiences and views, and for the initiation and
        development of service projects.
        <br>
        Its Governing Council comprises His Majesty
        King Constantine of Greece (Chairman), H.R.H. The Duke of Yorks, Mrs. Sonia
        Gandhi, Mr. Nelson Mandela, former President of the Republic of South
        Africa, and Mr. R. Kevan Gosper. Its mission is "Round Square is a worldwide
        association of schools which share a commitment, beyond academic excellence,
        to personal development and responsibility through service, challenge,
        adventure and international understanding".
